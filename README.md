A machine learning-powered web application that predicts potential forming defects in sheet metal manufacturing processes based on material properties and process parameters.

## üìå Overview

This application helps manufacturing engineers and material scientists:
- Predict potential forming defects in sheet metal operations
- Optimize process parameters to prevent defects
- Understand key factors influencing forming quality
- Compare different materials for forming applications

The system uses a Random Forest classifier trained on synthetic data simulating various sheet metal forming scenarios.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Material Database**: Includes 7 common sheet metals with mechanical properties
- **Defect Prediction**: Predicts forming defects (Wrinkling, Cracking, Buckling) or Successful Forming
- **Interactive Process Simulation**: Adjust process parameters and see predictions in real-time
- **Probability Analysis**: View defect probability distribution
- **Feature Importance**: Understand key factors affecting forming quality
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed model evaluation metrics
