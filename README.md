#Sheet Metal Failure Prediction App
This interactive Streamlit app predicts material failure modes (e.g., buckling, wrinkling, cracking) based on mechanical properties and loading conditions. It uses synthetic data, SMOTENC balancing, and a trained Random Forest Classifier for accurate classification. Ideal for engineers and researchers in materials and manufacturing.
